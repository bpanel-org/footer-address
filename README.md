# Footer Address Widget
This is a very simple widget for your bPanel footer that simply displays a
receive address from your app's wallet store (pulling from primary wallet's
default account). It uses the condensed Text component from
[bPanel UI](https://bpanel.org/docs/ui-components.html) that supports easy copy and paste.

This is meant as a demonstration of how you can create your own custom footer widgets and
is also helpful for testing purposes.
